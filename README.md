# Erik Williams Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, where you will find an updated selection of my most recent and prominent full-stack development projects. These projects combine personal endeavors and some assignments completed during my time at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. By delving into these projects, you will see a glimpse of my coding capabilities, design philosophy, and the breadth of technologies and frameworks I have worked with. The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed anytime through the Erik Williams Portfolio link. Here, you will find comprehensive details of each project, including its purposes, the challenges encountered during development, the solutions devised to overcome these challenges, and the final results.
